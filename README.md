# Non_GUI_Morse_Code_Generator
This is a small non GUI based Morse Code generator made using Python. We can integrate this code with a Python GUI and make it an interactive one. 
 1. data.py -- Contains the morse codes.
 2. encrypt_decrypt.py -- Contains simple encryption decryption logic
 3. main.py -- the main file.

Ideas:

1. Try making NATO code generator. :)

2. Try changing the symbols and make your secret code generator using the same, only you and your friend shall know the codes -- or more interesting -- encrypt a message send it to two or more friends out of which only that friend shall be able to read it who has the correct key to choode the proper decode values. :)

Happy Learning !
